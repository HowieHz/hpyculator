"使用方法：\n"
"    首先选择你要计算的东西\n"
"    然后在上方输入框输入你要计算的项数（行数）\n"
"    之后在左侧选择计算核心\n"
"\n"
"使用前必读：\n"
"    0.建议保存到文件，这样不会内屏输出导致卡死，再不济也开"
"启输出优化\n"
"    1.“保存”会将结果保存到程序所在目录下 \"Output\" 文件夹"
"内\n"
"    2.设置行(项)数较大请选择保存到文件，运算时间较长，可以"
"通过查看任务管理器确认程序是否假死，不同插件性能（读写性能"
"和运算性能）不同\n"
"    3.默认插件保存位置为程序同目录下的 \"Plugin\" 文件夹"
"内，可通过设置页面打开\n"
"    4.输入\" :tag \"进入tag搜索模式，如\" :tag 我是tag1 我"
"是tag2 我是tag3 \"，可用tag请下拉\n"

"How to use：\n"
"    First choose what you want to calculate\n"
"    Then enter the number of items (rows) you want to "
"calculate in the upper input box\n"
"    Then select the computing core on the left\n"
"\n"
"Before use:\n"
"    0. it is recommended to save it to a file, so that "
"the internal screen output will not be blocked, and the "
"output optimization will be started no more\n"
"    1. \"save\" will save the results to the \"output\" "
"folder under the directory where the program is located\n"
"    2. if the set number of lines (items) is large, "
"please choose to save to a file. The calculation time is "
"long. You can check whether the program is suspended by "
"viewing the task manager. The performance (read / write "
"performance and operation performance) of different plug-"
"ins is different\n"
"    3. the default plug-in saving location is in the "
"\"plugin\" folder under the same directory of the "
"program, which can be opened through the setting page\n"
"    4. enter \": tag\" to enter the tag search mode, such "
"as \": tag I am tag1 I am tag2 I am tag3\". Please drop "
"down the available tags\n"
